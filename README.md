# GPU Experiments

A collection of tests and benchmarks for my own research.

I originally created this repository to learn CUDA through hands-on coding. Now, I use it to run various micro-experiments that help me quickly develop new ideas.

## Requirements

- Thunderkittens
- CUDA 12.8 or above
- Hopper or Blackwell GPUs

Everything should be done through the Makefile.

## Topics

- A lot of random micro-experiments 
- Multi-GPU
- MXFP8
- IPC
- Attention
